# Poker Toolkit
Hello and welcome to my ___INCREDIBLE___ summer project.

This is a passion project in which I am building a java desktop application about poker, the specifications are further down this file, but first a little bit of general info.

One of the main aims of the project is to learn about the development proccess of a java app and the additional technologies used throughout, while still having a cool final product to use.

##### **Start Date:** 18/06/2024 <br> **First Release:** *"Not yet released"* <br> **Last Updated:** *"Not yet released"* 

## Features
The app contains the following features, this list is succeptible to changes:
- Accesible GUI built with Swing
- Ability to play poker hands with chosen cofigurations (stack size, num players...) against bots.
- Rewind tools to check move succesion and bet sizes.
- Recommended moves preflop based on tables
- Recommended moves postflop based on AI (Yet to commit to this functionality)
- Equity calculator blind.
- Win chance of hands during rewind mode.
- Hand matchups study section.

## Technologies
This project uses mostly java for all the development proccess. The build system used is maven and the support utilities, like parsers and model training (for AI if it is finally included) are done in python. <br> <br>
